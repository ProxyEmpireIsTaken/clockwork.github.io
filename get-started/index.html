      <summary>about:blanker</summary>
      <p>
        A standard of disguising, the about:blanker opens a new about:blank window with a iframe containing the website. Simple to create, simple to use, and usually quite effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        This method is easy to do - just drag the link below to your bookmarks bar!
